# Fusion-360-Milling-Post-Processor-for-Centroid
General Milling Post Processor for Centroid with additional Features

# Overview
This Fusion 360 Post Processor was originally based on the "Generic milling post for CENTROID" Version 42683 from the Autodesk HSM Post Library.

As the Generic Centroid Post Processor is lacking improved support for Rotary Axis and has no support at all for Fusion 360 Probing,
the Fanuc Post Processors from the Autodesk HSM Post Library have been used as templates to add improvements to this version of the Centroid CNC12 specific milling Post Processor.  

This Post Processor has only been tested with the Centroid Acorn board but should work with all of the Centroid Control Boards.
Using the Post Processor Properties to write Fusion 360 Information to CNC12 variables does require CNC12 Version 4.16 or higher.
