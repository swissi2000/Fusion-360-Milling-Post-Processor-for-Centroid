# #351 - #360 Tool Info for the first 10 Tools

## Description
Variable #351 - #360 hold the tool information of the first 10 tools being used in a job. Because *CNC12 User-String-Variables* keep their value until CNC12 is closed, it is necessary to reset the variables if less than 10 tools are being used. Otherwise it would be possible that tool information from an earlier job that was run in CNC12 would show up.

This is an example of the #351 - #360 information strings:

```javascript
#351 = "T1  D=4. TAPER=90deg - ZMIN=-1. - spot drill - 4mm Spot Drill"
#352 = "T3  D=8. ZMIN=-12.5 - flat end mill - 8mm Flat Endmill"
#353 = "T6  D=4. ZMIN=-6. - flat end mill - 4mm Flat Endmill"
#354 = "T9  D=6. TAPER=45deg - ZMIN=-1.3 - chamfer mill - 6mm Chamfer Mill 45 Degreel"
#355 = "T12  D=6.5 TAPER=118deg - ZMIN=-14.953 - drill - 6.5mm Drill 118 Degree"
#356 = ""
#357 = ""
#358 = ""
#359 = ""
#360 = ""
```
