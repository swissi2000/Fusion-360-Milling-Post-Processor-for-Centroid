# Write CNC12 Info Variables

![](/images/pp019.PNG)

## Description
CNC12 offers 100 internal *User-String-Variables* that can be used by macros during job execution. The names of these variables are *#300 - #399*.

If this *Property* is enabled, the Post Processor will fill *User-String-Variables* with Information from Fusion 360 that can be used within CNC12. By default, the following information will be written to the job file (click the variable name/number for more details from where in Fusion 360 the information is coming from):

### File, Setup and Tool Path Information
* [#300](300.md) Tool Info from the Fusion 360 Tool Library. Updated before each Tool Change
* [#301](301.md) Fusion 360 Design File Name. Defined at the beginning and does not change
* [#302](302.md) Fusion 360 Program Name/Number as specified in the Post Window
* [#303](302.md) Fusion 360 Program comment as specified in the Post Window
* [#304](304.md) Fusion 360 Setup Name. Changes for each Setup in the Post
* [#305](304.md) Fusion 360 Setup Notes. Changes for each Setup in the Post
* [#306](306.md) Fusion 360 Tool Path Name. Changes for every new Tool Path
* [#307](306.md) Fusion 360 Tool Path Notes. Changes for every new Tool Path

### Tool Info from the Fusion 360 Tool Library. Updated before each Tool Change in the Post
* [#308](308.md) Tool Type 
* [#309](308.md) Tool Unit (mm or in) 
* [#310](308.md) Tool Diameter
* [#311](308.md) Tool Number of Flutes
* [#312](308.md) Tool Coolant
* [#313](308.md) Tool Description from General Tab of Tool Settings
* [#314](308.md) Tool Comment from Post Processor Tab of Tool Settings

### Feed and Speed Info. Updated before each Tool Change in the Post
* [#315](315.md) Spindle Speed
* [#316](315.md) Spindle Direction CW or CCW
* [#317](315.md) Optimal Load (WOC)
* [#318](315.md) Maximum Step Down (DOC)
* [#319](315.md) Feed Rate
* [#320](315.md) Feed per Tooth
* [#321](315.md) Ramp Feed Rate
* [#322](315.md) Plunge Feed Rate
* [#323](315.md) Feed per Revolution

### Setup Info. Updated for each new Setup in the Post
* [#324](324.md) Origin Point
* [#325](325.md) Z Clearance Height. Useful in combination with checkApproach Property
* [#326](325.md) Current WCS

### First 10 Tools made available in variables when both Properties "writeTools" and "writeCNC12Vars" are true and variable name is assigned
* [#351 - #360](351.md) Variable that will hold the Fusion 360 Tool Info for the first 10 Tools used


## Implementation Details
All these *CNC12 User-String-Variables* are defind at the beginning of the Post Processor around code line #120:

```javascript
Post Processor Script
...
// Begin Customizable CNC12 User-String-Variables. Valid Numbers #300 - #399 -swissi
//To prevent a parameter of being written to the CNC-File, set the variable name to xyzVar = ""
var writeToolLineVar  = "#300"   // Holds Tool Information from the Fusion 360 Tool Library. Updated before each Tool Change
var designNameVar     = "#301"   // Holds the Fusion 360 Design File Name. Defined at the beginning and does not change
var programNameVar    = "#302"   // Holds the Fusion 360 Program Name/Number as specified in the Post Window
var programCommentVar = "#303"   // Holds the Fusion 360 Program comment as specified in the Post Window
var setupNameVar      = "#304"   // Holds the Fusion 360 Setup Name. Changes for each Setup in the Post
var setupNotesVar     = "#305"   // Holds the Fusion 360 Setup Notes. Changes for each Setup in the Post
var toolPathNameVar   = "#399"   <- Change User-Variable-Number if required
var toolPathNotesVar  = ""       <- This will NOT write this info to the job file
...
```

As seen on the last two examples on the list above, the name/number of the *CNC12 User-String-Variable* can be changed should any of these varibales conflict with a variable that's already been used in other scripts/macros. Just be aware that the example scripts provided here need to be adjusted to the new variable name/number.

Also if some of this information is not needed in a job file, setting the variable name/number to "" will skip that info in the output file. This is an example of a job file:

## Use Cases
Macros can be used to display the information from the User-String-Variables.

### Customized Tool Change Macro
Copy the example mfunc6.mac file from the [Repository](https://github.com/swissi2000/Fusion-360-Milling-Post-Processor-for-Centroid) to the *C:\cncm* folder. A M6 tool change will now provide the following additional information:

### Other Use Cases
* Check out the information about the [*Property: Add Command to Begin/End of Job*](addCommand.md) for more examples of how to use the CNC12 variables.
* Also check out the chapter [*Support for Manual NC Commands*](manualNC.md) for ideas of how to use *Manual NC* commands in Fusion 360 to display useful information in CNC12.
