# #300 Tool Info

## Description
User-String-Variable #300 makes tool information from the Fusion 360 Tool Library available. This variable will be updated before each tool change command.

This is an example of a #300 information string:

```javascript
#300 = "T1  D=4. TAPER=90deg - ZMIN=-1. - spot drill - 4mm Spot Drill"
```

The information is a combined string of

* Tool Number
* Tool Diameter
* Corner Radius (if any)
* Taper Angle (if any)
* ZMIN (Minimum tool length required for this operation)
* Tool Type
* Tool Description

## Information Source

### ZMIN (Minimum tool length required for this operation)
This value is calculated by the Post Processor based on the *Tool Path* and the total depth the tool needs to cut. So the *Flute Lenght/Tool Stickout from the Holder* must be at least the length of ZMIN.
