# #326 Current WCS

## Description
Variable #326 holds the configured WCS of the current *Setup*. This variable will be updated during job execution for each new *Setup*.

This is an example of a #326 information string:

```javascript
 #326 = "G54"   ; Current WCS
```

## Information Source
The default *WCS Offset* for a new *Setup* in Fusion 360 is *0*. If this is left at *0*, the Post Processor will assume that this is the first *WCS Offset* and will replace it with *1* which is G54.

The default *WCS Offset* can be changed in Fusion 360 by setting the WCS to 1 (G54) and then *right-click* the filed with the mouse and select *Make Default* from the pop-up menu.
