## Description
The default values for *Feed & Speed* are coming from the Fusion 360 Tool Library but they can be adjusted when setting up the actual tool path of the operation. 

These are examples of the #315 - #323 information strings:

```javascript
#315 = "6000"     ; Spindle Speed
#316 = "CW"       ; Spindle Direction
#317 = "1"        ; Tool Optimal Load (WOC)
#318 = "6"        ; Max Stepdown (DOC)
#319 = "375"      ; Feed Rate
#320 = "0.0208"   ; Feed per Tooth
#321 = "1920"     ; Ramp Feed Rate
#322 = "30"       ; Plunge Feed Rate
#323 = "0.005"    ; Feed per Revolution
```

When setting up the actual *Tool Path* in Fusion 360, all the *Feed & Speed* parameters are getting populated into the *Feed & Speed* Tab of the *Tool Path* and can be adjusted as needed:

The values in the variables *#315 - #323* are from the final settings that have been configured in the actual *Tool Path*.
