# #304 Fusion 360 Setup Name
# #305 Fusion 360 Setup Notes

## Description
User-String-Variable #304 holds the Fusion 360 Setup Name from the Fusion 360 CAM file. 

User-String-Variable #305 holds the Fusion 360 Setup Notes from the Fusion 360 CAM file.

These variables will update during the job execution if the job file contains more than one setup.

This is an example of a #304 and #305 information string:

```javascript
#304 = "Outside Contour and Holes"   ; Setup Name/Description
#305 = "Clamp in the Center Hole"   ; Setup Notes
```

## Information Source
By default, Fusion 360 numbers the Setups with Setup1, Setup2 etc. Rename the Setups to get a more descriptive name.
